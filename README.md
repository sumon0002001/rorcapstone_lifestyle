# lifestyle-app
I build a website based on lifestyle articles.
- To use the app, you have to sign in or log in
- Authenticated user:
  - can create articles categories
  - can create articles and link those articles to many categories
  - can comment on article
  - can vote an article
- The homepage shows a featured article (who has the biggest number of votes), and the list of all the categories in order of priority
- The category page show all the articles for a category
- The article page shows the content of an article.
